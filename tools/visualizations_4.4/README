To run a profiling session:
===========================
1/ Patch your 4.1 kernel using sched_profiler/sched_profiler_linux_4.1.patch,
install it, and reboot.. Warning: the patch only works for machines with 64 
cores at most, because some core bitfields ('considered_cores') are stored in 
64-bit integers.
2/ Go to sched_profiler/ and run 'make'.
3/ Then run your profiling session, using:

sudo insmod sched_profiler.ko

<Run something you want to profile.>

cat /proc/sched_profiler > output
sudo rmmod sched_profiler.ko

An example output file is provided in sample_output/. Check it looks like yours.

To plot graphs:
===============
1/ Enter the plots/ directory.
2/ You can use generate_rows_sched_profiler.sh to produce several graphs. You
may need to update some variables in the script. Example output is provided in
sample_output/.

You can have a look at parse_rows_sched_profiler.php and scripts in misc/ to
produce different graphs. For examples of graphs we produced, see:
http://sfu.lozi.org/results/

Not all scripts that have been used to produced these graphs are packaged in
this archive. For more information, send an e-mail to jplozi@unice.fr.

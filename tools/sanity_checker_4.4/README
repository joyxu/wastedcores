1/ Patch your 4.1 kernel with sanity_checker_linux_4.1.patch and reboot on the 
patched kernel.

2/ Compile the kernel module contained in stap_monitor (make).

3/ # insmod stap_monitor.ko
Doing so will start a timer that will periodically check invariants. The output 
of the timer can be seen using dmesg. This is the fastest and most lightweight 
way to check if invariants are broken.

4/ In order to generate full bug reports, you have to launch a systemtap script 
before insmod'ing stap_monitor.ko:

# stap stap_monitor_callg.stp
... wait for everything to be compiled and running
# insmod stap_monitor.ko

Systemtap will automatically dump execution traces of load balancing calls that 
failed to balance the load. You might have to add options to stap in order for 
it to work (by default systemtap has very conservative values for maximum 
possible overhead, and the overhead of generating the bug reports - when we do 
- is big).
